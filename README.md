# HODLOMETER.com

This is entire source code for hodlometer.com

It's idea is show it was better to use a simple algorithm to sell into stablecoins rather than just blindly HODL.

I intend to create an automated service to notify of crypto uptrends and potentially make a SaaS to manage that automatically using exchange API keys.

## Thanks

Thanks to amazing React, reactstrap, Bootstrap4, Firebase, Netlify to allow me to implement this idea so quickly.
