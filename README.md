# HODLOMETER.com

This is entire source code for [hodlometer.com](https://hodlometer.com)

It's idea is to show how better it was to use a simple algorithm to sell into stablecoins rather than just blindly HODL.

I intend to create an automated service to notify of crypto uptrends and potentially make a SaaS to manage that automatically using exchange API keys if there is enough interest.
